                        <h5>Text: Acts 2:22-39</h5>
                    <!-- message body -->
                        <p class="message-body">A covenant is an agreement between God and his people. One which God makes promises to his people with a part for the people to fulfil. We often times get tempted to misunderstand the concept of covenants and replace it with the term "promises". Well, a promise is an illusory where the promisor doesn't bind himself to anything and therefore furnishes no consideration for a valid commitment. Promises are not legal agreements and can be terminated without prior notice to the promised party. In fact, people generally break promises. A promise can also be described as an oral or written agreement to do or not do something. Now in conformity to the aforedescribed definition on what a covenant is; a covenant is a binding or solemn agreement which is legally contracted and more effectual than promises. In Genesis 12:1, God made promises to Abraham not covenants.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">In Genesis 15:18, Abraham's alignment with God ascended from a promise to a covenant. This was officially contracted and deemed legal. This finally yielded a result-The promise of Canaan broke forth. In Genesis 17, another covenant was established between God and Abraham. Then, In Genesis 21, the promises fortified by the covenants became real. Prior to this time, Abraham upon considering his age, doubted the workability of these promises because he never understood the dimensions of covenants. But then age, time and seasons have no power to contend with the force called covenant. In fact, they are too minute to stop promises backed by covenant. However, in the aforementioned scriptures, God in the course of his journey with Abraham played out his part but then in Genesis 22:15 Abraham had to fulfil his own part of the covenant-sacrificing Isaac. Shortly after that the bible records that God said "I swear by myself" Genesis 22:16 this was in fact the enactment of an everlasting covenant.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Now considering our text, Peter speaking here said some deep things-things beyond his title at the time. The phrase-predeterminate counsel as used in this scripture refers to things that were preordained before time. We see Peter here making emphasis on the ministry and purpose of Jesus. Deductively, In respect of the purpose of Jesus as described in this scripture, it is pertinent to note that John 3:16 is the representation of a predeterminate covenant between God the father and Jesus the son.  Consequentially, this agreement was legally contracted, this contract covered his death and resurrection. The bible speaking in Luke 24:5-8, John 20:9; 20-22; further affirms that there was a legal agreement between Jesus and the Father. He, Jesus accepted the death of the cross with a legal agreement in mind not a mere promise.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">He knew all that was to befall him beforehand and the glory afterwards. Now the bible in the Old Testament talks mightily of God's workings through Prophet Elisha, he had so much anointing but was void of the privilege of enacting a covenant with God. His dead bones raised the dead that lay beside him but yet, he died on account of ill health- no covenant. Being anointed of God or being redeemed by Christ with so many promises over your life is way different from having a factual covenant with God.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Covenants are established by revelation. Revelation births knowledge-the aspect of God you know is the dimension of God revealed to you. No wonder the bible says, my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Therefore, in the place of covenant enactment, we must know the truth (the revealed word) which will set us free to be beneficiaries of this heavenly package-covenant; John 8:32(paraphrased. You must be well informed by the Spirit of God in the place of fellowship in order to break forth in this dimension. Now, in John 11 the bible talks about Lazarus, a primary financier of Jesus' ministry who died after a brief illness. Though he was a major sponsor he never had the privilege of establishing a covenant. But then by contact he was connected to the representation of God's covenant with mankind- Jesus. Therefore, by understanding of who he was and his content, Jesus announced his covenant -the Covenant of life. Upon announcement, the covenant was activated and extended towards Lazarus. His announcement of the covenant symbolized that he recognized it and believed in it. In line with covenant establishment, The bible speaking in Genesis 6:8 talks about Noah a man who despite  the atrocities committed in his time, stayed true to God and found Grace before God.</p> 
                        <p class="message-body">Here, we see how God enters into a perpetual covenant with mankind through Noah symbolized by a rainbow. Now, among the disciples of Jesus, Peter and John were covenanted by purpose. Little wonder why, all the attempts on their lives failed, they only died when their assignments were concluded. Unlike Stephen whose purpose wasn't strong enough to secure a covenant of life for him. Paul became resistant to snake bites by covenant due to his purpose. Now in course of association, Lot never got a glimpse of Abraham's covenant with God; so he never had one. He followed a covenant carrier but never got a promise or a covenant. But then he became a beneficiary of the covenant of prosperity and prospered beyond measure-by association. Saul was picked and anointed to be King but never got privileged enough to share in a covenant. This deficit brought immediate demotion after his first mistake. Meanwhile, David was enveloped in series of covenants with God. Countless times, he made mistakes but never got punished or demoted.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">God's love for him was unwavering, mercy spoke ceaselessly on his behalf. Even dead traps via javelin thrown by Saul were waved off by covenant. Miriam was used by God, she heard from him directly but then she was void of a covenant. Her first mistake brought a judgment of leprosy. But Moses, a covenant bearer, faulted God's law-martially. Yet, he was preserved by covenant. After a period of immense prosperity, Lot disconnected from Abraham-his source of covenant by association. He decided to go solo-he lost it. We must learn to differentiate between anointing and grace. We must develop sensitivity towards certain carriers of grace, the bible speaking says many are called, few are chosen to be carriers of grace; Matthew 24:14 (paraphrased).</p>
                        <p class="message-body">We must learn to move from the dimension of mere Christianity to the place of becoming covenant carriers by Grace. Grace is infectious and contagious, Abraham had it and Lot benefited from it by sensitivity. Despite the fact that he was never part of the program, he followed. Miriam and Aaron never mattered until Moses became God's mouthpiece; Exodus 15. Moses was the symbol of their calling-their calling was insignificant without him. Absalom was doing alright till he opposed David-he was disgraced; 2 Samuel 15. Ahitophel with all his wisdom was not a topic of discuss until David became king by covenant; 2 Samuel 15. Peter was struggling until Jesus became part of his picture; Luke 5.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Having established the foundation for proper understanding of this divinity to humanity contract, it is important to connote its medium of activation.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">The covenant as enacted by God wasn't for Abraham but Isaac. By being an heir, he could access it. Jacob by virtue of being an heir was also a partaker.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">David and Jesus were descendants of Abraham and so were entitled to benefit from the covenant as well. Now, we are descendants of Abraham and are bonified partakers of this pre-established covenant. The bible in Galatians 3:14-15, describes the first activated portion of the new covenant- we are curse less. As seeds of Abraham we are embodiments of a "curse eliminating blessing". Affirmatively, Acts 3:25-26 establishes the condition attached to being a covenant carrier-being a seed of Abraham. Now the bible in Acts 2:38-39 further affirms our qualification as partakers. By understanding, Abraham was young enough at age 120 to marry a new wife. He never died till he fulfilled purpose-covenant of life.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Now, the bible speaking says Abraham prospered in cattle, crops, male and female servants-covenant of prosperity.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">The bible speaking also said Abraham was rich-covenant of riches.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">The bible speaking in Genesis, describes how by Abraham's mistake his wife was taken by Pharaoh, king of Egypt. God took up the battle and defended his covenant bearer-covenant of divine protection.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">The bible speaking in Genesis 21says, Abraham was blessed in all things (wealth)-covenant of wealth. God blessed Abraham with Spiritual and Material blessings. The spiritual was converted to the physical abundance he enjoyed-life exists in both dimensions.</p> 
                        <p class="message-body">Abraham's wife conceived in his old age. Consequently, by covenant-be fruitful and multiply, all three women he had relations with bore children-covenant of fruitfulness.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">The bible says, Abraham remarried at 120- Covenant of marriage. Conclusively, these covenants by understanding are for you and your children. But you must get a revelation of it through fellowship and then by understanding key into this God given legacy. Hallelujah!</p>
