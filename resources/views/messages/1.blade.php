                        <p class="message-head">Who are destiny helpers?</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Destiny helpers are people assigned to help you fulfil what God has commissioned you to do. They are tools used by God to manifest his plans for your life.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Now considering this subject further, it is important to note that scholars categorize helpers under three groups but in course of our study we will condition them under two groups.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">As the third if included would be angels. But then angels are beings assigned to minister to us. in other words work for us. Their functionality is indeed a huge task and will require adequate study upon activation. Therefore we'd focus on the other two;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> The Holyspirit </li>
                            <li> People </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="message-body">Now having mentioned the two dimensions of destiny helpers, We'd individualize our study for better understanding.</p>
                        
                        <p class="message-head">The Holyspirit: </p>
                        <p class="message-body">He is the most important. He might not be seen but he is a person and he is our greatest destiny helper as he operates in two dimensions/realms. He operates in the spiritual (heaven) and in the physical (on earth). According to Romans 8:26-27,</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> the holyspirit as a helper knows God's will for you. Jeremiah 29:11, 1 John 5:14. </li>
                            <li> He also knows the script written prior to your birth. </li>
                            <li> He knows the right prayer request thus he interceeds on your behalf. John 14:16, John 16:12-13. </li>
                            <li> He dwells in heaven while on earth and therefore should be desired by every believer as a best friend. </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p class="message-body">To go deeper into our study of the holyspirit as a Destiny helper. We'd understudy 8 capacities through which he functions. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>He is a Comforter (John 14:16.):</b> A comforter is one that comforts and soothes you during worrisome times. In other words, he pampers you and gives you spiritual massage.</li>
                            <li> <b>He is a counsellor:</b>  A counsellor is a person trained to give guidance and counselling. He gives stepwise counsel. </li>
                            <li> <b>He is our Helper:</b> A helper is a person who helps someone else. We all need help, someone who will assist you with your tasks.</li>
                            <li> <b>He is our intercessor:</b> An intercessor is one who interceeds on behalf of another especially by prayers. Romans 8:28.</li>
                            <li> <b>He is our advocate:</b> An advocate is one who publicly supports or recommends a cause or policy.</li>
                            <li> <b>He is our strenghtener:</b> A strenghtener is one that provides additional strength. His indwelling eliminates unnecessary fatigue and weakness</li>
                            <li> <b>He is a Standby:</b> Standby means in readiness for duty or deployment. </li>
                            <li> <b>He is our revealer:</b> A revealer is a person that tells you the future. He shows you, tells you and reminds you all you need to know.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="message-head">People:</p>
                        <p>These can otherwise be called human destiny helpers and are categorized as the second level of destiny helpers. There are five categories of human destiny helpers. They are;</p>
                        
                        <p class="message-body">Door openers transform your dreams to reality. Genesis 41:9.They announce you to the place of fulfilment. They are basically who know who you are and want to see you're doing better so they tend to announce you. They could be called Butlers as in the case of Joseph.</p>
                        <p class="message-body"> In Exodus 2:5-6, another destiny helper is discovered-Pharaoh’s daughter, here timing was of utmost importance as Moses appeared at the time his destiny helper was taking a bath. Destiny was calling Moses therefore he had to be timely in his appearance at the river bank otherwise he would have met the wrong person. Regardless of the fact that Pharaoh ordered the execution of the Hebrew children, Moses was spared by timely location. Pharaoh’s daughter here can be represented in various capacities - as one that opens palace doors for you, protects you and covers you peradventure you make mistakes. </p>
                        <p class="message-body"> In the case of Jesus another destiny helper is exemplified, Joseph of Arimathaea. Jesus had disciples with numerous gifts and anointing but he needed someone who could do what they couldn't. He needed an influential man who could establish a link to Pilate to offer him- Jesus a proper, decent funeral. This only proves that everyone around you is guided by purpose. Therefore, there is in fact no need for unhealthy competition as we all have our varying usefulness.</p>
                        <p class="message-body"> Men who fight your battles. 1 Chronicles 12:1. These volunteers are raised by the holyspirit. They love you enough to take up your fight without your instruction. These men are not often argued with, their opinions are highly respected and conclusive.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">And finally prophetic help. Ezra 5:2, 2kings 4:8. This is activated upon your connection with grace but It is subject to your ability to know the prophet assigned to you as a helper because not every prophet is assigned to minister help to you.</p>
