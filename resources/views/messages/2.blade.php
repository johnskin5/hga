                        <h5>Text: Esther 2:13-18</h5>
                        <p class="message-body">Basically, we could liken life to a seasonal movie script with series or chapters. The diversity of these chapters are often very pronounced as the experiences in these chapters tend to vary greatly. Some chapters are full of joy while others are enveloped with pain, sickness and possibly rejection. During this phase of chapter switch, sensitivity is a must have for every believer. Our study focus on Esther shows various chapters of her life. She was birthed into a family with probably some degree of comfort. Then, seasonal changes occur, the chapter switches from comfort to loss of both parents. Like every normal individual, she went through a season of tears upon the loss of her parents and moved on to a season of captivity. This was obviously a terrible season of her life. The chaos must have hit her so badly that she lost her family and then her home. The hidden truth in this case study is the value of laughter.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">One might not entirely appreciate laughter until there is a season of weeping. Your pain helps you appreciate your gain. But through it all, always remember that God speaking in Jeremiah 29:11 says, he knows the thoughts that he thinks towards you, thoughts of good and not of evil to give you an expected end. Note he never said he'll give you a good start or a good middle he talked specifically about your end because he operates from a futuristic realm.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">The 21st century is full of people with diverse problems, challenges and difficulties. Beauty, power and money might conceal them but for a fact, they still exist. It is therefore unrealistic to think that other people have no tough times. We all do! But the scripture said, all things work together for good to them that love God-Romans 8:28.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">He said "ALL THINGS" (the good, the bad and ugly) are all part of his plan. Things might not flow to you at your pace or dictate-every delay or denial fits into his agenda. Never force things or force God's hand to release things to you. In fact, deliberately let go anything you can't get by God's grace. It's not yours. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Now, back to our focal point-Esther. She had an outstanding feature that brought her uprising-she was connected to a man enveloped in grace. It is wrong to judge an embodiment of grace by his economic status because grace can make you. It is known to transform zeros to heroes 2chorintians 6:1-10. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Mordecai was a gateman enveloped in the grace of God. His occupation didn't determine the amount of grace he possessed.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Here, Mordecai gave Esther life changing information and taught her the value of silence when he charged her to keep mute on her background. He observed the verse of scripture that says, in quietness shall be your strength (Isaiah 30:15) because not every breakthrough is to be shared. Sometimes you have to learn to conceal vital information-Not everyone needs to know the extent of your success. In our key text, Esther had other competitors who were probably more beautiful than she was. Either way, she had something they didn't have-the grace of God. Esther probably knew what she carried but still yet she waited for her turn - she wasn't first on the list. She was patient. People around you may seem ahead of you but you have to wait for your turn. Patience is indeed a virtue and this virtue must be desired from God. Even as God values Faith, He also loves patience and the twain are inseparable. As God's own people we should learn to wait for his perfect timing, envy and jealousy shouldn't be part of what we do. After all the bible speaking says, time and chance happens to them all Ecclesiastes 9:11. The race is not to the swift, the battle is not to the strong; it is about the grace of God that will pick you from the bad side of life to where you ought to be.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">The bible specifically said, WHEN ESTHER'S TURN CAME, this implies that other turns preceded hers. This therefore implies that we should learn to treat people with respect as we cannot determine the move of God or fully understand his choice for a promotion. God doesn't exalt you as a result of your size, height or qualification. In fact he qualifies the unqualified in due season according to the workings of his grace. Now, back to our text. The bible never said Esther was beautiful, beauty was attributed to Sarah, Rebecca and Rachel but not Esther. The bible simply said Esther obtained favor and grace that was for a fact all she needed. God usually gives us what we really need if only we are sensitive to grab it and follow his lead.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Now, the term favor refers to God's preference about a particular person. In other words, partiality. The term favor has nothing to do with human qualification. Esther's turn came in the tenth month - the month of double grace. Grace is the superior dimension of Favor. It is important to know that everyone will get a turn but the favor you receive during your turn matters. Everyone will have an open door but the kind of door that opens for you is most important. Open doors are not the major breakthrough after all the women who lined up with Esther got open doors but never scaled through to royalty. The limelight here isn't really on Esther but Mordecai. Esther's new status never made Mordecai any less to her. She never placed emphasis on social stratification- it is easier to relate with people of the same economic or social class as you. Equality makes best friendship. With Esther's breakthrough, Mordecai was still serving as a gateman and there was no form of envy in his heart. The breakthrough of your friend should serve as a medium of motivation not a source of envy or jealousy.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Now, Esther had to be elevated in order for Mordecai to be promoted. Invariably, she was his way maker. In course of gatekeeping, Haman saw Mordecai's future and started making plans to crush it. Here the miracle surfaces, Esther was divinely positioned as a time bomb purposed to bring Mordecai's laughter against Haman's desires. Mordecai 's story was tied to Esther's success. In conclusion, the story line isn't centered on Esther's status upgrade but on Mordecai's breakthrough via this channel. Esther needed Mordecai to fulfil purpose and Mordecai also needed her to fulfil his. We all need each other in the journey of purpose, never get intoxicated by your breakthrough. It is a platform for someone's success story.</p>
