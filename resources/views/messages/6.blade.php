                        <h5>Text: Hebrews 11</h5>
                    <!-- message body -->
                        <p class="message-body">Everyone on earth was created and called. In fact, we were all created on purpose-no one was created by error. But then, a platform was needed to birth our existence. Therefore children born illegitimately most likely needed a non-marital relationship for their birth. Solomon, termed as one of the greatest kings to exist was a seed of a "murderous adulterous relationship". Yet, this didn't deter his kingly purpose-he simply needed a platform. Rahab, a prostitute was created so and divinely placed on a wall to bring victory to Israel. Obviously, she had a script to fulfil and therefore needed to be who she was in order to birth victory. Now, this victory brought her own transformation as the chapter of prostitution finished serving its purpose. However, Rahab as a prostitute was a tool to fulfil God's promise to Abraham-she had to be created a prostitute to fit into that phase.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">With respect to the subject "purpose" in 1 Samuel 16-17, David's brothers were not hungry; in fact they were too scared to be. Howbeit, by divine appointment and purpose his father had to send him with food, this was the start up for his kingly purpose. He needed to be divinely positioned. Conclusively, these acts symbolize Divine providence and affirms that God orchestrates every happening-the good, the bad, the ugly. Now, looking through the scriptures we'd discover that our arch enemy the devil is always at war with us but never has victory over us. Categorically, we could look at Job 1 where the devil talks about the hedge placed around him and God giving permission for his blessings to be touched and not his person.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Likewise, every believer has God's hedge round about us. But in line with purpose, permission can be granted for our hedge to be severed. In this book of the bible, neither the devil nor Job initiated the attack, God did. He served as the initiator and middleman in this transaction- both parties reported to him. However, in this scenario God had Faith in Job before he bragged about him. He knew what he created and wasn't afraid to test his product-he knew the stuff Job was made of.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">He knew he wouldn't chicken out. Besides that, he wanted Satan to know that he couldn't succeed as like he did in Adam's dispensation. Apparently, this product-Job was made of a superior material and Satan had to get the taste of losing a war on appetite. God saw Job's future the devil never saw it- he was recounting his past victories and banking on them. Here, God was seeking an opportunity to test run his asset, one whose future he knew and had Faith in. Job lost everything but it was only timely, it was relatively temporal- Again the devil didn't see it but God did. Undoubtedly, this was Job's purpose- he was the proof of God's Faith in man's future.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">To every man's life there is an existing call of God. This call has three dimensions;</p>
                        <p class="message-head">The first being; the call of followership</p>
                        <p class="message-body">When Jesus spoke to Peter in Luke 5, his first instruction after the draught was "follow me". The aftermath of this instruction was an "I will make you" promise. We all start in the place of followership and grow. But then in as much as success is not accidental, breakthroughs are not accidental, growing to the top is not also accidental. It is by intentional, conscious, deliberate and consistent steps.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">The second dimension is Discipleship. Contextually, it is a symbol of growth-it is a definition of the maturation phase of followership. A disciple is a student, a learner-one that must have the intent to learn. The final dimension is Apostleship. In other words, Missions. This is third dimension of growth in terms of a God's call. According to the bible in Matthew 10:1-2; Jesus, upon meeting his disciples asked them to follow him-first dimension of the call. The twelve in the course of time grew into disciples. They then evolved into Apostles. The term apostle is derived from the Greek word "apostles" meaning to be sent out on a mission. It is pertinent to note that God created man but will not make man grow.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">It is our responsibility to grow into full awareness of our part intentionally and consciously. We must see our future deliberately. Growing into the missions dimension is not centered on being called into the fivefold ministry. It is a reflection of the level of your personal revelation and understanding of God. A missionary is one sent to do something. We are commissioned by God to be mission officers in our sphere, our neighborhood. Now, reflecting on our study topic, "Faith in the future" we must know that;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>1. Faith has no business with the past.</li>
                            <li>2. When God is ready to expand you, he'll throw in some level of discomfort. Growth never occurs in oneâ€™s comfort zone. In fact, major breakthroughs occur in the place of discomfort.</li>
                            <li>3. Things don't just occur abruptly. Everything happening around you is preparing you for some request you put out into the universe. </li>
                            <li>4. Preparation time is necessary for your growth and must be intentionally, consciously, purposefully created by you.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="message-body">Tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today. Faith is about the future not the past, therefore people of Faith for see the future. They plan and prepare for it intentionally. Basically, they live for the future. Your past is the enemy of Faith. Faith is never in tune with your past. Regardless of how well you mourn the preceding events of your life, time lost can never be bought back. Simply look into your future and have Faith in it. Rahab had a horrible past-prostitution her encounter with God's own people- Israel, gave her Faith in her future. She never capitalized on her current status, she focused on her becoming-her future. Indeed, it paid off rightly, she became part of the ancestry of Jesus, Matthew 1:1. Likewise, our anticipation of the following year must be consciously planned and prepared for-it's our current future. Now, back to our text, God never told Isaac to bless his children.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">He simply acted in sync with God's program. Life is a race and batons must be transferred. However, relating the three dimensions of God's call with baton transfer; leadership in the same vein can be likened to a relay race. But here, batons in form of mantles are handed down from the top of the chain to the bottom link- Apostles to disciples; Disciples to followers. We see God call Abraham, Abraham on completion blessed Isaac-his son and handed over. Following the mantle transfer, God didn't instruct Isaac as much as he did his father. Yet Isaac discovered a hand down was necessary. In course of the hand down, he missed the place of divine providence as he was moved by the father-son connect between Esau and himself, but then he got it right. Our plans never actually determine our future. But Faith being a spiritual thing requiring the revelation of the arrangements of the all superior spiritual being-God for us. These arrangements are revealed only in the place of prayer and then our plans must align with them.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">We don't position the plans of God, we simply walk into it. Now, moving on to the next generation, Jacob at the time of blessing his sons, intended to bless Reuben but blessed Ephraim instead by divine providence. Here, Jacob was speaking into their future and according to this scripture intentionally decided their future. Amidst all his sons, he loved Rachel's sons more-he loved Rachel but then God loved Leah and so the lineage of Jesus stemmed from Leah. In course of prophecy, Judah had the most accurate prophecy-the scepter will not depart out of his hand; Genesis 49:10. The life of Benjamin was destroyed-he was described as a wolf. Meanwhile, Joseph got a favorable prophecy Genesis 49:22-27. Following after, Joseph wasn't a prophet he simply had the gift of prophecy. On his death bed, he gave specific commandments concerning his bones, Genesis 59:25. Howbeit, in the course of time, specifically 430years after his prophesy, his bones were a part of the trio in the promise land-Canaan. He had Faith in the future for his bones. People of Faith influence the future.</p>
                        <p class="message-head">Now, what is Faith?</p>
                        <p class="message-body">According to KJV, Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen the future in simply terms.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Now according to ESV, Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen-the future begins with you.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">According to NIV, Now Faith is being sure of what you hope for and certain of what you do not see-see the future you desire to walk into.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">According to Amplified, now Faith is the assurance, title deed, confirmation of the things hoped for, divinely guaranteed and the evidence of things not seen, the conviction of their reality. Faith comprises as facts what cannot be experienced by physical senses. Faith in action requires deadness of your senses. Conclusively, Faith in the future inspires you to see beyond your current sphere. It helps you develop capacity to be much more than you are. But first, you have to see your life as being better. According to 1 Samuel 17; when David spoke in contest of Goliath. He specifically said, he'll cut off his head. David never had a knife at the time-He had faith in the future. Categorically, when Jesus talked about destroying and rebuilding the temple in three days. His focal point was never in the past or the present, he had Faith in the future. Then in John 11, upon the death of Lazarus. He described Lazarus as one that slept-he had Faith in the future; Lazarus' awakening.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">In as much as, it was recorded that Jesus wept; he still walked in line- Faith in the future. In the same vein, the woman with the issue of blood desired to be made whole by touching Jesus-she had Faith in the future. Jarius upon meeting Jesus to heal his sick daughter, was told by friends and family about her demise. Still yet, he moved on with the master-he had Faith in the future. But then, we must deliberately get intentional to grow into this dimension- Faith in the future. Faith reaches into the future and shapes it. You must have the conviction of the reality of the things you say in faith before you say them. And with that conviction speak into your future. And always remember your past is the enemy of your future. Stop focusing on the failures of yesterday or the deterring state of today, look into the future with the eyes of Faith.</p>
