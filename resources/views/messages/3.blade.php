                        <p class="message-body">Adversity is an institute that teaches us to master our painful circumstances and revamp them for our benefit. Adversity can also be likened to a theologian college with the aim of pulling us back to our source- God and developing the habit of absolute trust in Him and his abilities. Furthermore, adversity is a tool for a deeper, more personal revelation of God's divine person to us. Unfortunately, People generally pay rapt attention to the pain than the lessons offered in this institute. One of the prerequisites of growing up is having to go through the educational system. However, here in Nigeria we run the 3,6,6,4 educational system. This simply implies that graduation from the nursery system to the primary system and beyond was subject to your performance during the preceding term. This performance was however subject to your ability to grasp the lessons offered quickly.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Now the aforementioned pattern is specifically for the Nigerian educational system. However, the following chapters of learning are ensued in the school of adversity. Its attendance is not usually very much observed by the attendee but an invisible certificate is often awarded. To the layman, the school of adversity is simply the school of unpredictable problems. To succeed in this school of adversity you must have a masterâ€™s degree in pain management. The beauty of this management is your ability to turn it around for your benefit. Spirituality, healthy relationships, power, affluence, financial or social status is not a gateway to evade this school. Problems are not confined to location or timing, it is solely to help us grow in our ability to master pain. David speaking said, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death - he was simply referring to the school of adversity. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Zachariah and Elizabeth were righteous, holy and blameless before God but it didn't keep them for mastering pain. It didn't stop them from being grandaunts of the school of pain. The problems you face work in two dimensions- to make you grow or pull you down. In fact, problems are stepping stones for those that are wise to grow further. They could also be the reason for a lasting defeat for some others. Therefore, the focal point of this teaching is to guide an undergraduate in this institute. To focus right- on the lessons offered. The kind of lessons often offered include;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Financial lessons-in this case God wants to make you grow beyond depression during money shortage.</li>
                            <li> Health lessons- He wants to build your Faith and enable you love him beyond your ill health. This love can only be evidenced in your actions at the time.</li>
                            <li> Job redundancy- He wants to see your attitude when you are relieved of your job. His major expectation is for you to call him just as Job did. Back to our key text, the bible says there was famine in the days of Abraham. Abraham's mastery of famine determined God's manifestation in his life. Now this issue of famine became concurrent as it happened consecutively in the following generations. In reaction to economic status, Isaac relocated out of his placement like many of us would during difficult times. In the same light, the bible speaking in Ruth 1 speaks of a family who relocated from the house of bread to a neighbouring settlement-Moab.  They never found bread in this new zone. Rather, they met chaos and death, Naomi had to go back to the house of bread-wounded, battered and destroyed. In our key text, Isaac was in his promise land, divinely provided. Now the promise land was to be a place of zero lack. But here was Isaac suffering famine.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="message-body">Now, looking at Deuteronomy 8:8-10,it looked like God's promises failed, there was major scarcity in the land, there was lack of bread as opposed God's promises in the preceding scripture. The promises of God were going in the opposite direction and God's covenant with Abraham seemed like it had failed. Therefore Isaac relocated in the face of adversity. Meanwhile God allowed scarceness to evaluate the content of Isaac's heart. When things refuse to fix themselves you fix it after all the bible says the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent taketh it by force. Turn your pain into your gain. Turn your problems to your solution, insult to your stepping stone. Instead of feeling depressed, arise and work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. Never leave the house of bread, face it. It might look like there is no light at the end of the tunnel, but stay. The essence of this message is to make you understand the importance of digging your well rather than waiting for a ready-made well to drink from. Get to work and start digging your well. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Back to our key text, Abraham experienced famine and God never instructed him or gave him directions. Abraham was mature enough to handle some things by himself even without direction. He was able to take the right steps to arrive at the point of God's promise towards him. In Isaac's time upon facing famine directions were given by God. This countered his decision to go to Egypt. Remember God never countered Abraham's decision but he did counter Isaacs' because Isaac wasn't mature enough to handle Egypt. Everything Isaac needed was pre-provided, he never went through turmoil. Egypt wasn't meant for soft people as it was a training ground for hard people. God refused to train Isaac there. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Now in Genesis 46:2-3, Jacob being the 3rd generation was specifically instructed by God to go find help in Egypt. Jacob was raised to handle tough matters, places and circumstances. He was a predestined man of war who started fighting from the womb, and graduated to fighting with God and finally fought with his uncle-Laban to collect a well. Your ability to go through tough times yesterday and turn out victorious is indeed an indication that you are in the path of pain mastery, therefore if that didn't break you; nothing else will. Therefore it is important to note that God allows affliction based on our maturity. In fact, the extent of your challenges is tied to your purpose; it's not different from it. In other words, be careful during this phase of adversity and take note of your major must have-direction. Direction is the greatest thing you need during the season of adversity. Now, what is direction? Direction simply means </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> The what </li>
                            <li> The how and </li>
                            <li> The when. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="message-body">Genesis 21 reveals Isaac's dual nature- Isaac in adversity and Isaac in prosperity.  Genesis 21:1-11 specifically dwells on Isaac in problems and verse 12 shows Isaac in prosperity.  It is important to note that everyone experience this dual phase. But then your handling your phase of adversity determines the turn up during your days of prosperity. The bible speaking says when you go through the storms, He'll be with you, He never said he'll deliver you. Truth is, you have to master the storms. Champions are those with numerous scars and scars are a proof of mastery in the school of adversity. Your challenges are to reveal another dimension of God to you- Isaiah 55:8. God tried Isaac by his divine providence - Genesis 26 and we will all get tried. Nothing can stop it, it can only be managed and mastered. Now a shocking part of this scripture is, the sudden lack struck Isaac deep it the abundance his father stored up for him -your ability to generate and sustain wealth is tied to your ability to generate wealth for yourself by learning what your father did. Isaac never knew God personally because his father always prayed for him. You can only master grace during adversity. The school of adversity never graduate people on trial but mastery. In the chapters preceding Genesis 26, God never appeared to Isaac. He only did in d face of adversity where Isaac made a wrong decision, here his father's covenant played out. </p>
                        <p class="message-head">Preambles to master adversity. </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Stay </li>
                            <li> Obedience </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="message-body">Obeying God makes him bless you and butter your bread. It is important to know that God reveals himself differently to every man and generation. Here, is the keynote, God made promises in Genesis 12, yet Abraham, Isaac and Jacob acted foolishly - they were pressure and lied. Pressure could make people act badly. Never judge people based on their actions under pressure. Pressure reveals the human nature- Even Jesus was a victim of this nature as he approached a fig tree yet to reach its fruit bearing season. He cursed the tree. He also manifested this nature when he flogged people out of the temple. In John 11:35, he wept. That was him being human. And finally it manifested when he asked God to take the cup of the cross-discouragement is part of being human. Even Peter denied Jesus upon discouragement. But you have to learn to edify yourself with the right words. Note your current predicament was someone's victory can you make it yours as well? When things you can't control happen, refuse to focus on them-try to control your life. Behind every glory there is a story. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Now back to case study, God blessed Abraham without his personal effort and Lot became blessed by contact. Abraham's days were the days of Favor and sadly yes, we are not in his phase but in Isaacs'-the days of Labour. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">At the time Abraham's wife was taken in Egypt due to his lie, God intervened. In Isaac's time, God never responded. God never prospered Isaac miraculously he simply taught Isaac to prosper. Genesis 26:12, Isaac sowed, God never told him to, he simply gave him wisdom to know what to sow. God told Isaac to sow, he never sowed for him. In our generation, God blesses what you do. Back to Isaac's case, he sowed, prospered and got envied. Yet God had to train him in another dimension- to sustain his prosperity by digging wells. He had to dig his own well because that was the reality of his generation. God is going to give you an idea to dig out. Stop feeling depressed, stop complaining and start digging your well. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">In further study it is important to note that, there are 4 sets of well to dig.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">First note that well digging is intentional. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Genesis 15:19</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Isaac dug first and his followers dug theirs. Equality makes best friendship. </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Esek-Well of contention, misunderstanding and quarrel. Genesis 26:20.</li>
                            <li> Shebah-more strife. When there is more contention, there should be more focus. Genesis 26:21
                            Digging needs concentration, effort and continuity. It will consume your energy and your skills.</li>
                            <li> Rehoboth-Isaac was focused and determined therefore he didn't relent. He dug till his enemies gave up fighting him. Truth is, you can't have overnight success. Genesis 26: 22. Never allow any pressure, attack or situation stop you from digging another well. Dig your well to the point where quarrels, misunderstanding and strife ends. The name Rehoboth is simply the Lord has made room. The first degree of success was for children. The real success came when he dug the third well-the true definition of success is tied to people's acknowledgment of your success. Your success is also legit when it affects lives positively. 
                            Now back to Isaac he was told by God to remain in Gerar but he maximised it enough to extend to Beersheba- there is indeed dimension of success that cannot be contained in one locality, it must spread. This dimension exists in the place of mastery. In Genesis 26 God finally appeared to Isaac after being silent during the strife period. He wanted to know if Isaac knew what he wanted. This was the beginning of Isaac's journey with God but this was through God's covenant with Abraham. As a matter of fact, God generally decides to bless you because of your spiritual father- He recognizes leadership. Conclusively, Isaac raised an altar and dug the fourth well.</li>
                            <li> The altar well This well attracted successful people to him as he was affirmed a success by his enemies. The altar by this well completely terminated strife and permanent. Now reflect upon the businesses, investments you would have made some time ago upon waiting for God's instruction, you missed out. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="message-body">Well, God will never ask you to dig a well, he'll simply offer back up and bless what you start up. We need to add Labour to favor to enjoy our desired harvest.</p>
