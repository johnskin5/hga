                        <h5>Text: Proverbs 23:18</h5>
                    <!-- message body -->
                        <p class="message-body">There is the supernatural but you need to connect to it in order to enjoy its physical manifestation. In other words, your connection to the supernatural determines how you'll benefit from it. Now the force that connects you to the supernatural is your expectation. Therefore to enjoy supernatural flow, you must have an expectation. Expectation births manifestation. Zero expectation equals zero manifestation. Furthermore, God releases blessings when your expectation is intact. From our key text, the word "end" refers to the final part of something. Now considering the same term under three varying capacities;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Theologically, it means to bring to an end satanic attacks and affliction. Therefore, you can end demonic afflictions and problems as well as those attacking and harassing you. Bearing in mind that satanic problems can never last forever but will come to a timely end. After all, the bible speaking says weeping may last only for the night Psalms 30:15(paraphrased). It is not a 24/7, 365days routine; it is timely and specific to only the night season. In other words, affliction will last only for a moment. </li>
                            <li> It means a reward. In this scenario, your attackers are rewarded by God as your afflictions come to an end. Now, the reward is commeasurable to the extent of your attack. They are rewarded with evil, pain, just as they sowed. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="message-body">End could also mean result. A negative or positive result is the offshoot of everything that ends. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Finally, end could mean future. The end of a thing marks the beginning of another. In this light, we could look at Joseph; his brothers thought they had ended his life when they put him in a pit and finally sold him off as a slave. Well then that was the beginning of his future. They simply ended the father dependency phase only to unlock the prime minister future. They were trying to end his dream, little did they know they were pushing him to the place of a better result with an uncommon reward. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Still from our text, let's consider the word expectation. Expectation is what you want to happen. With this in mind, when men say there is a casting down; you will say there is a lifting up; Job 22: 29 . When one door closes against you, you must have an expectation that seven other doors are about to open for you. Expectation is the mother of the supernatural. Now for those about to give up on themselves, it is helpful to know that the problem is only a platform for the best; there is going to be a turn around. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">There is hope for you in the supernatural. Mockery qualifies you for a new level. Considering the term expectation, it is important to note that your expectation should stem from God's perfect will. Once your expectation deviates from God's plan, it fails. The bible speaking in Jeremiah 1:5 paraphrased says during conception, God had a plan for you. Therefore in order to have a physical manifestation of your expectation, you must know God's promises for you-your purpose. Now to establish this further, you must first of all understand that you never promised yourself a blessing; the one who made you did. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Psalm 62:5 confirms that our expectation is from the Lord. In other words, you are not expected to have an expectation until you discover God's expectation for you. Only God's plan stands sure and your purpose is the most important thing. When you don't know who you are, you'll be moved by every wind of doctrine. The bible speaking says the desires of the righteous shall be granted but then to get these desires granted you must first know God's promises concerning you. In Luke 22:42, the bible talks about the promises of God for your life. Before we go deeper into Luke, it is expedient to first look at Judges 6, Gideon was struggling as he had not discovered God's promises for his life. He didn't know the promise so had no expectation. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Therefore there could be no manifestation. In line with promises, the bible speaking says, for I know the thoughts that I think towards you, thoughts of good and not of evil to give you an expected end-Jeremiah 29:11 (paraphrased), though your beginning be small, thy latter  end shall greatly increase. Gideon was created a leader, a solution carrier, but was reduced to the level of seeking for survival. His family was termed the poorest because he bore the purpose to alleviate them from poverty. When he discovered himself, his family status upgraded- You have to discover things rather than pursue after them. According to the bible, there was a girl named Esther who became an orphan in the course of slavery became a queen and in turn became the reason her uncle ascended from the gate to being prime minister. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">In 1 Samuel 30, David was faced with a life threatening situation. One which he needed God to speak. God did speak and assure him of victory but he needed to discover a stranger- destiny helper on the way. But he had to treat this stranger right. Now, according to the scripture in Luke 22:42-44, Jesus went to pray in the garden of Gethsamene. He went to tell God his expectation but God countered it-Human expectation is subject to divine expectation. Before you were born, there was a divine expectation, therefore your human expectation cannot override Divine expectation. Don't be afraid of pain, pain shouldn't affect your expectation. In this chapter of scripture, we see Jesus pray in his deepest agony. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Yet his prayers were not taken- your challenges, problem, pain shouldn't deter your expectation. Those who get distracted never get to their promise land. When your bearing is towards the north never drift southwards irrespective of how the wind blows. Today, you might not move as fast as you did yesterday, but the truth is you are still advancing. You've got to hold on and not give up. Your enemies may go all out against you, regardless of the size of their weaponry, it will not stand because God is with you and he will turn it around for you. Jesus refused to allow his agony stop the will of God for him. His pain never affected his future expectation. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">The problem with most believers is the inability to know who we are and Mark the promises of God for us. In Jesus' ministry, Miracles were only a side dish they were not the main meal. Miracles were not his purpose, his purpose was his death and resurrection and he clearly defined it. Most of us often settle for less than God's ideal plan. We should rather desire a sustainable miracle. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">In Conclusion, the scripture says there is an end. The pain of your past, your pain of today, and your fear of tomorrow must end now even as you deliberately pay less attention to the problem. Focus much more on the future. You might not have your desired breakthrough today but you will tomorrow. The race is not to the swift, the battle is not to the strong but time and chance happens to them all; Ecclesiastes 9:11. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">You must believe your breakthrough is on the way. At the right time, it will surface. Look into your future and pay attention to it. The scripture speaking says, No weapon formed against you will prosper, this doesnâ€™t disapprove a gang up. Neither did the bible say, the weapons wouldn't be formed. The promise was the futility of their plan not failure for them to gather. In Luke 5, the bible talks about a man called Peter who had no immediate joy during fishing but then his joy was full thereafter. His disappointment became his appointment. If Peter had caught fish he wouldn't have had a net-breaking, boat-sinking miracle, let alone fulfil purpose-the rock. Jesus needed an empty boat to birth Peter's purpose and his inability to catch fish was the beginning of his self-discovery. Your disgrace qualifies you for grace. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Stop complaining. The ministry of Judas was to make Jesus go to the cross, he had to be close enough to fulfil purpose. Oh believe it or not, you need haters like the brothers of Joseph to sell you to your place of purpose. Joseph remained focused on his dream, he never argued. There was an aspect of the dream he never told his family-God revealed the pathway to him (his brothers). Now back to Luke 5, Peter had a difficult time catching fish but then he was washing his net. Net washing was an indication that he was ending his period of shame- Fishermen typically wash nets after a huge catch. Jesus needed to use his boat to preach but then Peter carried his net (his expectation). Peter talked about his past but never let go his expectation (his net). Most people give up because they feel the pains of yesterday would overshadow tomorrow-the problem of yesterday was the appointment for tomorrow. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Now, Peter had a mega breakthrough but chose his purpose over it. Miracles could fade but the source (God) never goes short. Never let your breakthrough steal the place of your purpose and never let go your expectation. Hang in there, God's got you.</p>
