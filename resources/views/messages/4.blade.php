                        <h5>Text: 1 kings 18:37, Isaiah 30:19</h5>
                           
                        <p class="message-body">The bible speaking says the people shall dwell in Zion. Zion here refers to the church. It is a safe spiritual homeland. Zion is God's dwelling place and our stay. Here, the scripture specifically instructs those in Zion to discontinue weeping because God is working on taking tears off their faces. Now, letâ€™s talk about Zion a little bit. Zion is not a church denomination it's God's dwelling place. This dwelling place is recorded in the Old Testament as Zion. Zion being the church is a place of refuge Isaiah 14:32. This verse of scripture refers to the afflicted in Zion not the afflicted outside Zion. Affliction is not an indication to leave Zion- there is no solution outside Zion. Affirmatively, there is no help outside Zion. Any help outside Zion is an arranged help- it is not God given. God is omnipotent, omniscient but is location specific - he doesn't go everywhere. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">He chooses to help his people in Zion therefore issues should be brought to Zion. Psalms 102:13. God's mercy is for the afflicted who remain in Zion. They might not have the answers to their request speedily but they stay put. The bible when referring to Zion used the second person pronoun "her" because nations and kingdoms are addressed as such. Psalm 128:5; According to this scripture God blesses us in Zion because that's our Jerusalem. Church is located in Akwa Ibom. We get blessed in church, to affect our community, society and nation- God gathers his people in church basically for this purpose. You don't shine in church but in the city- when you go out of church the manifestation shows up. The blessing is not in the city but in Zion. Remember, Hannah's conception occurred in Zion not in her house. The wailing of those in Zion got to God thus he decided to rain down answers. Joel 2:32 gives a super affirmative revelation of God's ability to rain down answers in Zion. In mount Zion there shall be deliverance and your mourning will be turned to dancing as you possess your possession-Obadiah 1:17 (paraphrased) always remember that in Zion.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> God will arise and have mercy on you. </li>
                            <li> You will possess your possession. </li>
                            <li> There will be a visitation. </li>
                            <li> There will be deliverance. </li>
                        </ol>                        
                        <p class="message-body">Deliverance refers to God's ability to remove satanic impediments that oppose and hinder the promises of God concerning your life. Most believers misunderstand the concept of the cross and misplace it with "no need for deliverance messages". They tend to ignore the increasing number of societal and health challenges we face daily. Well Jesus died to take all this away, but then we have to rise up with knowledge and understanding to move these obstacles out of our way in the place of prayer. We are expected to command these things to move past us into the realm of zero existence. The scripture says, thou shall weep no more, this simply implies that there was a situation with weeping within the church. But here in Zion today, God is wiping away tears.</p>
                        <p class="message-body">Now, this is an important part of the message; He will be very gracious unto you. He is not being gracious to your situation. He doesn't respond to your situation, rather he responds to your voice in that situation. When situations come and you don't speak, God can't respond because he acts on what you say. God hears and answers. Now back to Hannah's case, she was barren, she was ridiculed but she never called to tell God her pain. God never responded-her barrenness never gained God's attention. In Genesis 13:22, the bible says God remembered Rachael and harkened to her-she called. Prior to that time, she was barren but she never called, she allowed the state of barrenness overshadow her voice. In the same vein, Rebecca was barren for 20years, Sarah was barren for 25years but they both paid attention to the barrenness and never cried to God. Then, mercy prevailed in Sarah's case and she got the promise-Isaac. God had promised Abraham children but Sarah wouldn't have waited 25years to see the promise well her mouth was shut so she had to. Now, God observed that Sarah never intended to ask and her husband-Abraham wasn't a man of prayer, he simply complained. Genesis 15-18 therefore, the barrenness prolonged. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">God had already established a covenant with Abraham, he never wanted it to fail so he had to answer himself. He kept calling and no one picked he had to do the needful. Moving on from that generation to the next- Isaac. He never established a personal relationship or covenant with them. He simply went silent. Isaac was barren for years, his wife never prayed. Isaac had to take up the call; he begged God and there was an instant answer- Somebody's voice went and God answered. God was waiting for them to call. This message is for those ready to call. Romans 10:13 defines our theme- no calling, no saving. Matthew 7:7 stands to confirm that if you don't ask, you can't be given. Jeremiah 33:3 affirms and establishes that your answer is subject to your ability to call. The bible speaking in Acts 2:21 says whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved. To balance this message Romans 10:14-17 establishes that Faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of the Lord but then answers don't come by Faith, answers come by praying. Therefore, when Faith is built there must be a calling. The bible speaking says how can they preached if they are not sent but here today, God has sent his prophet with a word to announce to you that when you call he'll answer. You've got to play your part and call. But then you can't call when your Faith is low. Therefore the word has to be taught to build your Faith so you can boldly call. For the bible speaking says whoever cometh to God must first know that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him Hebrews 11:6. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">It also said that without Faith it is impossible to please God. We live by Faith, teach by Faith and walk by Faith. Your Faith must produce results. As you speak by Faith, may God grant your request. The bible says, Faith without works is dead. Works here is you having an expectation. As the word is taught it reflects in that area. One purpose of this message is to build your faith. But then you don't receive by having Faith, you receive by speaking faith. If you don't have Faith you can't please God, consequently if you don't speak Faith, it doesn't work. Speaking faith makes it a reality in your life. The woman with the issue of blood spoke in faith in her house- if I could touch the hem of his garment and yes, it worked for her. Matthew 9:20. She didn't speak while at the field but in her house, she came expectant-works. God responded to her voice within her house just as he did in Genesis 21 where he heard Ishmael's voice. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">This takes us back to our theme, God never answers your cry but your request. Now back to our text, Elijah cried and said Answer me oh Lord. Focusing on that verse alone will cause you to miss the miracle which lies in verse 24. Elijah is entrapped in a battle. He chooses to call on his God. The first miracle here is knowing your God in other words getting more personal with him. Being a part of church attendance is far from knowing him on a personal level. Back to our text, Isaiah 30:19-20: it is important to note that God gives you adversity and affliction not the devil. Sarah, Hannah, Rebecca and Rachel's barren states were arranged by God. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Pleasure is replaced with pain. But here God is saying, I know I brought the affliction and adversity to your doorstep yet all you have to do is call me. However, our mistake is indeed tied to our misbehavior during this phase, we often get depressed and stop attending church services. He allows things happen to know the extent to which we know him. The bible speaking in Psalms 91says, he that dwells in the secret place of the most high; note however that your status during the indwelling is not clearly stated. The bible never said you won't get attacked it simply said your deliverance is sure. He might not handle your case immediately but he sure will. Now the focus of this message is to introduce God better. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Most times we see him as the God of the mountain, we tend to forget that he is also the God of the valley. The God of glory is the God of pain. Don't get perplexed when are not blessed, your anger doesn't shake him. He is simply trying to build you for a mega testimony. Finally, lets revisit 1kings 18:37 and marry it with Exodus 7:10, Elijah called on the name of his God and Moses acted on the instruction of his God, his rod became a serpent that swallowed up all other surrounding serpents. First, Moses had to introduce the name of his God. Note the similarities in both cases - The name. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">Here we see the Old Testament living in the New Testament with the name- Jesus. But then they had to know him to know his name. Until you know who you are, life will ridicule you. And knowing who you are stems from knowing your God. Unlike Baal, our God doesn't sleep, slumber or travel he is ever beside us. He said he'll never forsake us. Elijah repaired the altar that was broken, he put things in order, he added water- he was sure to prove his God was alive. Finally, he invoked covenant as he called on God. God responded. Note however, that there was no fire when Elijah called but then he knew exactly how to call and the showed up. He never focused on the problem or complained, he spoke. Don't tell God the problem he knows already, tell him the solution. </p>
                        <p class="message-body">In conclusion, according to Isaiah 30:19, God has to hear you to answer you. Therefore say it out loud so he could hear and give you the joy you've been longing for.</p>
